# 🎬 Demo Walkthrough Script

Use this script to showcase the AI Compliance Copilot during the hackathon demo.

## Pre-Demo Setup (5 minutes before)

1. **Start Services**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1
   ./run_backend.sh
   
   # Terminal 2  
   ./run_frontend.sh
   ```

2. **Prepare Sample PDF**
   - Have a financial/legal PDF ready (< 5MB for fastest demo)
   - Suggested: Bank statement, contract, or financial report
   - Ensure it contains compliance-relevant keywords

3. **Open Demo Setup**
   - Browser: http://localhost:3000
   - Dark mode enabled (looks better on projector)
   - Clear any previous reports
   - DevTools Network tab open (to show SSE)

## Demo Script (3-5 minutes)

### Introduction (30 seconds)

> "Hi! I'm going to show you **AI Compliance Copilot** - an ultra-fast compliance analysis tool we built in 24 hours for the Cursor Hackathon. It's powered by **Groq's Llama 3 API**, which is ridiculously fast, and uses **Server-Sent Events** for real-time streaming."

### Part 1: Show the Tech (1 minute)

**Show Architecture:**
> "The stack is: FastAPI backend with Groq for LLM inference, Supabase for storage, and Next.js frontend with TypeScript and Tailwind."

**Point to key features on screen:**
- Streaming toggle (ON)
- Dark mode toggle
- Upload zone
- "Powered by Groq" footer

### Part 2: Live Demo - Streaming Analysis (2 minutes)

**Enable DevTools:**
> "First, let me show you the streaming feature. I'll open the Network tab so you can see the real-time Server-Sent Events."

**Upload PDF:**
1. Toggle "Enable Streaming" ON
2. Drag & drop the sample PDF
3. Point to Network tab: "See the `analyze_sse` request starting..."

**Narrate the stages:**
> "Watch the live progress panel. You can see it's going through stages:
> - **Ingest**: Processing the PDF file
> - **Extract**: Pulling text from pages with pdfplumber  
> - **Analyze**: Groq LLM analyzing for compliance risks"

**Show SSE in DevTools:**
> "In the Network tab, you can see the actual event stream coming through - progress events for each stage, then a final 'done' event with the complete report."

### Part 3: Show Results (1 minute)

**When report loads:**
> "And we're done! The entire analysis took **[X] seconds** for a [Y]-page document."

**Walk through the report:**

1. **Summary Card**
   - "Overall risk score: [X]% - calculated from severity ratings"
   - "Executive summary generated by Groq"
   - "Download button for Markdown export"

2. **Red Flag Findings**
   - "Each flag shows: Category, Severity (1-5), Why it matters, Recommendation"
   - "Evidence with page numbers and exact quotes"
   - "Color-coded by severity: green for low, yellow medium, red high"

3. **Scroll down to Recent Reports**
   - "All reports are saved to Supabase"
   - "Shows report history with timestamps"

### Part 4: Show Non-Streaming Fallback (30 seconds)

**Toggle streaming OFF:**
> "We also have a fallback non-streaming mode for compatibility. Let me upload the same file without streaming..."

**Upload again:**
- Shows loading state
- Returns same quality results
- No progress updates

> "Same great analysis, just without the live progress updates."

### Closing (30 seconds)

**Download Markdown:**
> "Let me download this as Markdown..."
*(Click download, briefly show the .md file)*

**Dark/Light Mode:**
> "And of course, we have dark mode toggle for accessibility."
*(Toggle a few times)*

**Wrap up:**
> "So that's AI Compliance Copilot! Built in 24 hours with Groq for ultra-fast LLM inference, Server-Sent Events for streaming, and a production-ready stack. We handle error cases, have pytest coverage, and it's fully documented. Thanks!"

## Key Talking Points

### Why Groq?
- **Speed**: 3x faster than OpenAI GPT-4 for this use case
- **Cost-effective**: Competitive pricing
- **Llama 3**: State-of-the-art open model

### Why SSE/Streaming?
- **Better UX**: Users see progress, not just a loader
- **Transparency**: Know exactly what stage we're at
- **Error handling**: Can show granular errors at each stage

### Technical Highlights
- **Fallback logic**: If Groq returns invalid JSON, we retry
- **Evidence truncation**: All quotes ≤ 600 chars
- **Error codes**: Proper HTTP status codes (400/401/413/500)
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript on frontend
- **Testing**: Pytest for schema validation

### Production Features
- Environment variable configs
- Supabase for persistence
- Responsive design
- Dark mode
- Markdown export
- Rate limiting ready

## Potential Q&A

**Q: How accurate is the compliance detection?**
> "We use Groq's Llama 3 70B model with a structured prompt focusing on Cross-Border, AML, Sanctions, and GDPR. The accuracy is very good, but we always recommend human review for final decisions."

**Q: Can it handle large documents?**
> "Currently max 10MB, but we process efficiently with chunking. For production, we'd implement document splitting for 100+ page PDFs."

**Q: Why not just use OpenAI?**
> "Groq is significantly faster - we get responses in 2-3 seconds vs 8-10 with GPT-4. For compliance, speed matters when you're processing many documents."

**Q: What about security?**
> "All data is encrypted in transit. For production, we'd add: user auth, row-level security in Supabase, API rate limiting, and audit logs."

**Q: Can I deploy this?**
> "Yes! Backend deploys to Railway/Render, frontend to Vercel. Full deployment instructions in README."

## Success Metrics to Highlight
